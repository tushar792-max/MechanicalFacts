### Instructions to Run
1. Create a file named `index.html`.
2. Copy and paste the above code into the `index.html` file.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the application in action.

### Explanation
- A button with the ID `replace-facts-button` is added to the HTML.
- A new array `newFacts` is created, containing a different set of facts.
- The `displayFacts` function is modified to accept an array of facts to display.
- An event listener is added to the button, which calls `displayFacts(newFacts)` when clicked, replacing the current facts with the new ones.
